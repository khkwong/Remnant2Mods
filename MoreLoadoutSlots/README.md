# MoreLoadoutSlots

Raises the Character screen's loadout count from **8 to 20**.

## What it does

- Adds 12 extra loadout tiles to the Loadouts panel, reachable by mouse-wheel
  scrolling in a slim in-panel scrollbar.
- Every extra slot behaves exactly like a vanilla slot: right-click to save,
  left-click or Space to equip, F to delete — same confirmation dialogs, same
  rules (can't overwrite the currently-equipped loadout, can't load/delete an
  empty one).
- Gear saved in the extra slots is stored in your regular save file and
  survives relaunches.

## Requirements

- Remnant 2 (Steam/PC)
- [UE4SS](https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS) — experimental-latest build

## Installation

1. Copy the `MoreLoadoutSlots` folder into `<Remnant2>\Binaries\Win64\ue4ss\Mods\`.
2. Add a line for it in `ue4ss\Mods\mods.txt`:
   ```
   MoreLoadoutSlots : 1
   ```
3. Launch the game.

## Known limitations

- Scrolling to slots 9+ is mouse-wheel only; gamepad focus-scroll is untested.
- Saving/equipping into an extra slot while in another player's co-op session
  is untested (should work, following the same rules as vanilla slots, but
  hasn't been verified).
