# MoreLoadoutSlots — mod reference

Status: **feature-complete and user-confirmed** as of 2026-07-12 (solo and co-op display; first shipped mod of the project). Source: `MoreLoadoutSlots/Scripts/main.lua`. This doc is the what/why of this mod specifically; engine/UE4SS techniques live in `docs/remnant2-modding-research.md` (the §3.4 series — this mod's build-out IS most of that section).

## What it does

- **20 loadout slots instead of 8** on the Character → Loadouts screen. The count is a single knob: `TOTAL_LOADOUT_SLOTS` at the top of `main.lua`.
- **Record capacity**: on every player spawn (`PlayerController:ClientRestart` hook), all `LoadoutComponent.Slots[].NumRecords` are patched to `TOTAL + 1` (21) so the underlying storage accepts the high record indices.
- **Extra tiles**: when the Loadouts panel is constructed (`NotifyOnNewObject` on `Widget_LoadoutsPanel_C`), 12 extra `Widget_Loadout_C` tiles are created via `WidgetBlueprintLibrary.Create` and appended to the panel's tile list, using record indices **8, 9, 11–20** — record **10 is skipped** (the game's reserved "Last Gear State" auto-save; a visible tile there self-overwrites on every equip).
- **Scrolling**: the panel's fixed 688px tile area only fits 8 tiles, so a runtime-created engine `ScrollBox` is spliced into the widget tree (`SizeBox_0 → ScrollBox → LoadoutList`); overflow tiles are reached with the mouse wheel.
- **Labels**: tiles past the skipped record get a pinned `LabelOverride` so on-screen names run a contiguous "Loadout 9".."Loadout 20" with no gap. (LoadoutNamer's custom names layer on top of this.)
- **Interactions**: each mod tile subscribes the panel's own handlers to its delegates (`OnClicked`/`OnLoadoutSaved`/`OnLoadoutSlotDeleted` → `OnLoadoutClicked`/`OnLoadoutSlotSaved`/`OnLoadoutSlotDeleted`) — the exact bindings the panel gives the tiles it creates itself, so save/load/equip/delete behave 100% vanilla, including the equipped/empty gating and confirmation dialogs. A hook-forwarding fallback path exists for tiles whose native binding fails (it hasn't fired since the UE4SS experimental upgrade).

## User guide

There is nothing to configure or learn — the extra slots behave exactly like the vanilla eight:

| Input (on a loadout tile) | Action |
|---|---|
| **Left-click** or **Space** | Equip that loadout |
| **Right-click** | Save your current gear into that slot |
| **F** | Delete the slot's contents |

- **Scrolling**: only 8 tiles fit on screen at once; use the **mouse wheel** over the tile list to reach slots 9–20.
- Vanilla rules still apply: you can't overwrite-save onto the currently equipped loadout, and clicking an empty slot does nothing.
- **Persistence**: loadouts saved to the extra slots (including slot 20) survive full game relaunches — they live in the game's own save data, same as vanilla slots. Note this also means gear saved in extra slots stays in your save even with the mod disabled; it's just not visible/reachable until the mod is re-enabled.
- **Changing the slot count**: edit `TOTAL_LOADOUT_SLOTS` in `MoreLoadoutSlots/Scripts/main.lua` and relaunch (or hot-reload and reopen the screen). Anything from 9 up should work mechanically; 20 is the tested value. If you *lower* it, gear already saved in now-hidden slots isn't deleted, just unreachable.
- **Co-op**: browsing and seeing the extra slots while in a multiplayer session works (fixed 2026-07-12). **Saving/equipping the extra slots (9+) while in someone else's game is untested** — do it in your own world until proven safe.

## Key implementation facts

- Record indices: vanilla tiles 0–7, mod tiles 8, 9, 11–20. **Record 10 = the reserved Last Gear State auto-save** — never given a visible tile; `NumRecords` is patched to `TOTAL + 1` to account for it (research doc §3.4w).
- Tiles MUST be created with `WidgetBlueprintLibrary.Create`, not `StaticConstructObject` — the tile class's `ComponentDelegateBinding` (button clicks → tile handlers) is only applied during `UUserWidget::Initialize()`, which raw construction skips (a raw-constructed tile renders but ignores all clicks). The engine `ScrollBox`, a plain C++ widget with no such bindings, is safe to `StaticConstructObject`.
- CreateWidget's owning player comes from `panel:GetOwningPlayer()`, never `FindFirstOf("PlayerController")` — the latter returns a non-local controller in multiplayer and CreateWidget then yields an invalid widget (§3.4cc; `FindFirstOf` survives only as a logged fallback).
- Each tile gets `Index` (record), `LoadoutTemplate` (the `Gear_Loadout` asset), a `LabelOverride` when its record runs ahead of its visible position (FText-wrapped — mandatory), the three delegate subscriptions, then `Refresh()` and `AddChild`.
- Delegate binding failure rolls back any bindings that landed (a half-bound tile on the fallback path would double-fire) and registers the tile in `ourTileFullNames` for the hook-forwarding path: post-hooks on the tile class's mouse bound events + `OnInputAction` (enum: 1 = equip/Space, 3 = delete/F) forward to the current panel's handlers, with manual equipped (`EquippedIconBox:IsVisible()`) and empty (`IsEmpty`) gates re-creating the checks vanilla tiles do pre-broadcast.
- Tile creation waits on a 50ms poll (max 40 attempts) for `panel.LoadoutList` to become valid, then runs in the game thread; a `GetChildrenCount() >= 20` guard makes reruns idempotent. `currentPanel` is re-captured on every panel construction — screen reopens build a fresh panel, and acting on a stale closured one was a real bug.
- The `SizeBox` deliberately keeps its native 688px `HeightOverride`; the ScrollBox handles all overflow.

## Known warts / deliberate scope cuts

- The tile list has no gamepad-focus scrolling guarantee — scrolling was built and tested for mouse wheel (gamepad users may not reach slots 9+; untested).
- Saving/equipping extra slots while in another player's co-op session is untested (H2 — LoadoutComponent write safety was proven with exactly one component instance, solo; a co-op session may hold several locally). Display/browsing in co-op is confirmed fine (§3.4cc).
- The hook-forwarding fallback path (and its two behavioral gates) is dead code in practice since native delegate subscription works on experimental UE4SS — kept as a safety net because it's the only path that works if a UE4SS regression removes delegate `:Add()` support.
- The "Loadout N" numbering assumes tiles are only ever appended by this mod; a vanilla patch that changes the base slot count or the reserved-record position (10) would misalign labels and the skip logic.
